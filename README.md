# csgo-coach-bug-detector
Detects if a coach has been abusing the "coach-bug" in games

Will only be used for running on old demos so this program doesn't really have a future. Coded with that in mind :)

Feel free to do whatever under the license, I appreciate pull requests.

Thanks a lot to https://github.com/markus-wa/ who created the parser of the demos that I'm using.
